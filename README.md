This repository documents my journey through the **Backend Development Roadmap**.  

---

## 📅 Progress Log  

### ✅ Day 1  
- Installed Python  
- Set up Git and GitHub repository  
- Wrote first Python program: **Hello World**  
- Practiced basics:  
  - Variables  
  - Data types  
  - User input  
- Pushed first commit to GitHub  

---

### ✅ Day 2  
- Practiced **conditionals (if/else)**  
- Learned about comparison and logical operators  
- Created and committed `conditionals.py`  
- Synced updates with GitHub  

---
## Day 3 - Loops

### Topics Covered
- `range()` for flexible loops
- Looping over strings
- `enumerate()` for index + value
- Using `break` and `continue`
- Nested loops practice

### Exercises
- Iterated over the word "backend"
- Skipped `'e'` using `continue`
- Stopped loop at `'n'` using `break`
- Practiced printing index + character

### Key Takeaways
- `range(start, stop, step)` gives you full control of loop iterations.
- Strings are iterable, so you can loop character by character.
- `enumerate()` saves you from writing manual counters.
- `continue` skips one loop turn, `break` stops the loop entirely.

## 🔜 Next Steps (Module 1)  
- Learn about **loops (for, while)**  
- Learn about **functions**  
- Practice with small coding exercises  
- Set up **virtual environment (venv)** for project isolation
